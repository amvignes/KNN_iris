KNN on Iris Dataset
 
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flowers in the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


Project Objective

The main goal is to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and classification algorithms. By working with KNN, I aim to learn how to code in Python and grasp the fundamentals of supervised learning.


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies a sample based on the 'K' nearest labeled data points in feature space. It predicts the class by examining the majority class among its nearest neighbors. In this project, the Iris dataset provides both features and labels, enabling the KNN algorithm to learn patterns and make predictions effectively.


Learning Process

Through this project, I am gaining hands-on experience with classification methods, which is essential for understanding more complex AI concepts. KNN serves as an excellent introduction to supervised learning and data-driven decision-making.
